# Initialization Log  
**Repository:** Neurotransparency-Doctrine  
**Maintainer:** Waveframe Labs  
**Governance:** Aurora Research Initiative (ARI)  
**License:** CC BY 4.0  

This log records the foundational creation events for the Neurotransparency Doctrine repository.  
All future modifications must reference this entry and maintain governance continuity.

---

## 1. Repository Creation
**Date:** 2025-12-01  
**Action:** Repository initialized under Waveframe Labs for the standalone publication and governance of the Neurotransparency Doctrine.  
**Rationale:** Doctrine separated from AWO to achieve repository-level identity, DOI-based citation, and institutional independence per ARI governance rules.

---

## 2. Initial Directory Structure
The following directories were created and placed under ARI metadata governance:

- `/doctrine/` — canonical markdown source  
- `/figures/` — branding and diagrams  
- root-level `CITATION.cff` — formal scholarly reference  

No generated artifacts (PDFs) are stored in the repository.

---

## 3. Initial Descriptor Files Added
Descriptor files created according to ARI Metadata Policy (v1.0.0):

- `doctrine/descriptor.yml`  
- `figures/descriptor.yml`  

These establish directory purpose, version lineage, and traceability.

---

## 4. Canonical Doctrine Added
**File:** `doctrine/Neurotransparency_Doctrine.md`  
**Version:** 1.0.1 (document identity)  
**Status:** Active  
**Notes:** Metadata block normalized and aligned with ARI metadata requirements.

---

## 5. Banner Asset Added
**File:** `figures/neuro_doc_banner.png`  
**Purpose:** Used for visual identity in README and future PDF artifacts.

---

## 6. Governance & Alignment
This repository operates under the following governance principles:

- ARI Metadata Policy  
- ARI Governance Specification  
- Neurotransparency as an epistemic invariant  
- No generated outputs committed to source control  
- All PDFs produced exclusively via the Waveframe PDF Forge  

---

## 7. Release Preparation
Repository prepared for **initial release: v1.0.0**, which will include:

- Canonical doctrine markdown  
- CITATION.cff  
- Repository README  
- Descriptor files  
- Release notes (to be drafted at publication time)

No PDF included; users generate via the Forge.
