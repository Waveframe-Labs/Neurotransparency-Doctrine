# Neurotransparency Doctrine  
## An Epistemic Primitive for AI–Human Scientific Collaboration

**Author:** Shawn C. Wright  
**Affiliation:** Waveframe Labs / Aurora Research Initiative

## Preamble

AI-assisted research is now produced by distributed cognition: humans, synthetic models, workflow engines, and automated validators operate together to generate scientific claims. Yet the reasoning that shapes these claims is increasingly irrecoverable. Human intuition leaves no audit trail. Model reasoning is erased by context-window limits and version changes. Automated processes transform information without a reconstructible justification path.

Scientific legitimacy cannot survive when the cognitive processes behind claims become unrecoverable.

The **Neurotransparency Doctrine** establishes the non-negotiable epistemic conditions under which cognition—human or synthetic—may influence a scientific claim. It replaces trust with traceability, intuition with evidence, and authority with reconstructibility.

---

## 1. Core Principle

**No inference may influence a scientific claim unless its origin and reasoning path are externally visible, independently attributable, and permanently preserved.**

Neurotransparency is not an interpretability tool, ethical preference, or best practice.  
It is an **epistemic boundary condition**:  
if the reasoning behind a claim cannot be reconstructed, the claim has no legitimacy.

---

## 2. The Collapse of Cognitive Transparency

Legacy science assumes that cognition is:

- local  
- stable  
- attributable  
- inspectable  
- reproducible  

In AI-assisted research, none of these assumptions hold.

Today, reasoning is:

- distributed across multiple agents  
- ephemeral within context windows  
- altered by model-version shifts  
- obscured by undocumented human intuition  
- transformed by automated workflows  

This opacity is not a methodological inconvenience—it is an existential threat to scientific validity. Without neurotransparency, synthetic cognition becomes a black box and human cognition becomes invisible.

---

## 3. Axioms of the Doctrine

The doctrine consists of eight epistemic axioms that define the minimum conditions under which cognition may contribute to a scientific claim.

### Axiom 1 — Attribution  

Every reasoning step must be explicitly attributed to a declared cognitive role.  
Anonymous cognition has no epistemic status.

### Axiom 2 — Evidence-Linkage  

A claim is admissible only if verifiable pointers exist linking it to the reasoning and evidence that produced it.

### Axiom 3 — Integrity  

All reasoning artifacts must be preserved in immutable, integrity-protected form.

### Axiom 4 — Independence  

No cognitive agent may validate its own reasoning.  
Strict separation of roles is mandatory.

### Axiom 5 — Continuity  

The reasoning trail must remain reconstructible across time, context loss, model updates, and agent turnover.

### Axiom 6 — Minimal Reasoning Unit  

The smallest admissible unit of cognition must contain:  

- a declared role  
- explicitly identifiable evidence  
- a stable output  
- a timestamp  

Anything less is metadata, not cognition.

### Axiom 7 — Downstream Validity  

If any reasoning step becomes unverifiable, all derivative claims lose epistemic validity.

### Axiom 8 — Trace Over Trust  

Legitimacy derives from reconstructible cognitive trace—  
not expertise, intuition, reputation, or institutional authority.

## 4. Why Neurotransparency Is Required

Distributed cognition has dissolved the conditions that once made science verifiable.  
In this new environment:

- authorship is fragmented  
- reasoning is unstable  
- context is volatile  
- synthetic inference is opaque  
- human intuition is unrecorded  
- workflows obscure transformation paths  

Without cognitive provenance we cannot determine:

- who reasoned  
- why decisions were taken  
- whether claims reflect evidence  
- whether model updates invalidate prior reasoning  
- whether intuition silently replaced missing justification  

A claim without cognitive provenance is epistemically meaningless.

---

## 5. Human and Synthetic Cognition Are Epistemically Equal

Neurotransparency rejects anthropocentric epistemic privilege.  
Human intuition is not self-justifying, and model inference is not inherently opaque.  
Both must meet identical evidentiary standards:

- traceable  
- attributable  
- reconstructible  
- integrity-protected  

This establishes epistemic equality between human and synthetic cognitive agents.

---

## 6. What Neurotransparency Is Not

To prevent dilution, the doctrine specifies what it *does not* require:

- interpretability  
- explainability  
- exposure of private thought  
- surveillance or behavioral monitoring  
- justification of internal cognition  
- architectural modifications to AI systems  

Neurotransparency applies **only** to cognition that influences scientific claims—  
the moment reasoning leaves the mind and enters the record.

---

## 7. Ethical and Epistemic Consequences

Neurotransparency produces a new model of scientific legitimacy:

- **Accountability without intrusion** — only claim-affecting reasoning is recorded.  
- **Post-institutional validation** — legitimacy derives from evidence, not affiliation.  
- **Procedural trust** — trust emerges from traceability, not authority.  
- **Epistemic equity** — humans and AI must meet identical standards.  
- **Future-proof science** — reasoning remains valid across time and model evolution.

---

## 8. Doctrine–Specification Boundary

The doctrine defines **why** neurotransparency is required.  
The **Neurotransparency Specification (NTS)** and **AWO / CRI-CORE** define **how** it is operationalized through:

- schemas  
- enforcement mechanisms  
- role separation  
- integrity guarantees  
- validation constraints  

**The doctrine is philosophical.**  
**The specification is a compliance target.**

---

## 9. Adoption Requirement

Any workflow that utilizes distributed cognition to produce scientific claims must adopt neurotransparency as a structural invariant.

Partial or interpretive adoption **undermines epistemic legitimacy**.  
Cognition can influence a claim only when **all** reasoning steps satisfy neurotransparency.

---

## Conclusion

Neurotransparency is the epistemic primitive for AI–human scientific work.  
It restores cognitive integrity in environments where reasoning is distributed, synthetic, and unstable.  
It ensures that science remains reconstructible, auditable, and legitimate.

The doctrine provides the foundation.  
The specification provides the machinery.  
Together, they define the next stage of scientific reproducibility.
