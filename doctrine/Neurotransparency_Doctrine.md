# Neurotransparency Doctrine  
*Epistemic Foundations for Cognitive Integrity in AI–Human Scientific Workflows*

---

## Document Position & Authority

**Purpose of this document**

This document defines the **philosophical and epistemic rationale** for Neurotransparency.

It explains **why** cognitive traceability, attribution, and reconstructibility are necessary in
AI–human scientific work.

**This document is not:**
- institutional law  
- a compliance specification  
- an enforcement policy  
- a governance authority  

Normative requirements, enforcement mechanisms, and institutional authority are defined and
ratified exclusively by the **Aurora Research Initiative (ARI)** and its adopted standards.

---

## Preamble — The Epistemic Crisis of Distributed Cognition

**Intent:**  
Describe the modern scientific context in which cognition is distributed across humans, AI systems,
workflow engines, and automated tooling, and explain why traditional assumptions about transparency,
authorship, and trust no longer hold.

This section establishes the *problem space*, not the solution.

---

## 1. The Core Claim of Neurotransparency

**Intent:**  
State the central philosophical claim of Neurotransparency: that cognition influencing scientific
claims must be externally traceable to preserve epistemic legitimacy.

This section frames Neurotransparency as an *epistemic boundary condition*, not a rule set.

---

## 2. The Collapse of Classical Cognitive Assumptions

**Intent:**  
Explain why legacy assumptions about cognition (locality, stability, inspectability, attribution)
fail in AI-assisted and automated research environments.

This section motivates the need for a new epistemic foundation without prescribing enforcement.

---

## 3. The Axioms of Neurotransparency

**Intent:**  
Present the eight axioms of Neurotransparency as **epistemic principles**, not institutional
requirements.

Each axiom should describe a condition that must *hold for legitimacy to exist*, rather than a rule
to be enforced.

### 3.1 Attribution  
*(Why anonymous cognition lacks epistemic standing)*

### 3.2 Evidence Linkage  
*(Why claims must remain connected to their reasoning and evidence)*

### 3.3 Integrity  
*(Why cognitive artifacts must be protected against silent alteration)*

### 3.4 Independence  
*(Why self-validation undermines epistemic trust)*

### 3.5 Continuity  
*(Why reasoning must remain reconstructible across time and system change)*

### 3.6 Minimal Reasoning Unit  
*(Why cognition must be decomposable into re-evaluatable units)*

### 3.7 Downstream Validity  
*(Why unverifiable reasoning propagates epistemic failure)*

### 3.8 Trace Over Trust  
*(Why legitimacy derives from traceability rather than authority)*

## 4. Cognitive Provenance as a Scientific Primitive

**Intent:**  
Explain why provenance must apply not only to data and artifacts, but to cognition itself.

This section reframes cognition as a first-class scientific object.

---

## 5. Human and Synthetic Cognition

**Intent:**  
Establish epistemic symmetry between human and synthetic cognition.

This section rejects anthropocentric privilege while preserving human oversight as an interpretive,
not authoritative, function.

---

## 6. What Neurotransparency Is Not

**Intent:**  
Explicitly delimit the scope of the doctrine to prevent misinterpretation or overreach.

Clarify that Neurotransparency does not require:
- interpretability of internal cognition  
- exposure of private thought  
- surveillance of agents  
- architectural changes to AI systems  

---

## 7. Relationship to the Aurora Governance Stack

**Intent:**  
Define the clear hierarchical relationship between this doctrine and downstream governance,
specifications, and tooling.

This section prevents institutional overlap and authority confusion.

**Conceptual layering:**
- Neurotransparency Doctrine — epistemic rationale  
- Neurotransparency Specification (NTS) — normative standard  
- ARI — institutional authority  
- AWO — methodological implementation  
- CRI-CORE — enforcement and execution  

---

## 8. Adoption as an Epistemic Commitment

**Intent:**  
Describe adoption of Neurotransparency as a philosophical stance rather than a procedural checklist.

This section explains *why partial adoption undermines epistemic coherence* without asserting
institutional enforcement.

---

## 9. Implications for Scientific Legitimacy

**Intent:**  
Discuss how Neurotransparency reshapes trust, validation, authorship, and reproducibility in
post-institutional science.

This section focuses on consequences, not requirements.

---

## Conclusion — Neurotransparency as a Precondition

**Intent:**  
Reaffirm Neurotransparency as a foundational epistemic concept necessary for credible AI–human
science, independent of any specific institution, tool, or implementation.

---

## Glossary (Optional)

**Intent:**  
Provide precise definitions for key terms used in the doctrine (e.g., cognition, traceability,
provenance, epistemic legitimacy) to avoid ambiguity and drift.
