## Overview  
The Neurotransparency Doctrine establishes the epistemic boundary conditions required for cognition—human or synthetic—to legitimately influence scientific claims.
It defines the eight axioms of neurotransparency, forming the philosophical foundation for:  
- Neurotransparency Specification (NTS)    
- Aurora Workflow Orchestration (AWO)  
- Aurora Research Initiative (ARI)  
- CRI-CORE

Neurotransparency replaces trust with trace, ensuring that scientific reasoning remains reconstructible, attributable, and integrity-protected in distributed AI–human workflows.
