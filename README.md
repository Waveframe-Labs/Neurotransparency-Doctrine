## Overview

The **Neurotransparency Doctrine** defines the epistemic conditions under which cognition — human or synthetic — may legitimately influence scientific claims.

It establishes eight axioms governing:
- attribution
- traceability
- integrity
- independence
- continuity
- falsifiability
- downstream validity
- legitimacy through trace rather than trust

The doctrine is **epistemic**, not procedural.  
It defines *why* certain cognitive standards are required — not *how* they are enforced.

---

## Authority & Scope

This repository contains the **canonical philosophical doctrine** of Neurotransparency.

It **does not** function as institutional law, enforcement policy, or tooling specification.

### Relationship to ARI

- **Aurora Research Initiative (ARI)** is the constitutional governance authority.
- **Neurotransparency Doctrine** defines epistemic admissibility conditions.
- **Neurotransparency Specification (NTS)** defines structural and compliance requirements.
- **AWO** and **CRI-CORE** implement enforcement under ARI governance.

Neurotransparency informs ARI.  
ARI governs Neurotransparency.
