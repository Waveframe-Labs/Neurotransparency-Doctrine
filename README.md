## Overview  
The Neurotransparency Doctrine establishes the epistemic boundary conditions required for cognition—human or synthetic—to legitimately influence scientific claims.  
It defines the eight axioms of neurotransparency, forming the philosophical foundation for:

- Neurotransparency Specification (NTS)  
- Aurora Workflow Orchestration (AWO)  
- Aurora Research Initiative (ARI)  
- CRI-CORE  

Neurotransparency replaces *trust* with *trace*, ensuring scientific reasoning remains reconstructible, attributable, and integrity-protected in distributed AI–human workflows.

---

## Scope & Context  
This repository hosts the **canonical source** of the Neurotransparency Doctrine.  
It provides the philosophical and epistemic foundation for the entire Aurora research ecosystem.

What this repository contains:

- The doctrine (Markdown format)  
- Figures, banners, and citation metadata  
- License and citation files  
- Version history and governance logs (as added)

What this repository does *not* contain:

- PDF artifacts  
- Specification-level requirements (these belong in the NTS repository)  
- Tooling, workflows, or executables  
- AWO or CRI-CORE implementation files  

This separation ensures clarity, provenance, and long-term governance integrity.
