# Neurotransparency Doctrine — Governance Log

This log records **governance-level decisions, approvals, and oversight actions**
for the **Neurotransparency Doctrine** repository.

It is the canonical record of how the doctrine is maintained, revised, and
positioned under **Aurora Research Initiative (ARI)** governance.

This log is **append-only**. No historical entries may be modified or removed.

## Governance Events

| Date (UTC) | Action | Role Exercised | Outcome | Governance Impact |
|------------|-------|---------------|---------|-------------------|
| 2025-12-01 | Standalone Doctrine repository created | Maintainer | Approved | Doctrine formally separated from AWO archives and brought under ARI governance scope. |
| 2025-12-01 | Doctrine v1.0.0 frozen for initial release | Maintainer | Approved | Canonical text stabilized; dependencies limited to Neurotransparency Specification (NTS). |
| 2025-12-01 | Repository structure & metadata audit | Auditor | Compliant | README, CITATION.cff, LICENSE, descriptors verified against ARI norms. |
| 2025-12-01 | PDF artifact policy ratified | Auditor | Compliant | Canonical source of truth defined as Markdown; PDFs restricted to deterministic release artifacts. |
| 2025-12-16 | Doctrine refactored to epistemic-only role (v2.0.0) | ARI IC | Approved | Removed normative authority; doctrine explicitly subordinated to ARI governance and NTS compliance layers. |
| 2025-12-16 | Governance alignment review completed | ARI IC | Compliant | Confirmed no overlap with ARI Epistemic Doctrine; doctrine reclassified as philosophical rationale only. |

## Governance Position (Authoritative)

- The **Neurotransparency Doctrine** is a **philosophical epistemic framework**, not institutional law.
- **ARI** is the sole authority for governance, enforcement, and compliance standards.
- **NTS** defines normative structural requirements derived from the doctrine.
- **AWO** and **CRI-CORE** implement method-level and tooling-level enforcement under ARI authority.

Any change affecting:
- core axioms,
- the doctrine’s epistemic scope,
- or its relationship to ARI / NTS

**MUST**:
1. increment the doctrine version,
2. be recorded as a new entry in this log,
3. update citation metadata where applicable.
