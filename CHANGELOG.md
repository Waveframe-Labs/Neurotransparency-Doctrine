## [2.0.0] — 2025-12-16

### Epistemic Reframing (Breaking Conceptual Change)
- Repositioned the doctrine as a **philosophical / epistemic rationale**, explicitly
  non-competitive with ARI’s Epistemic Doctrine.
- Removed implicit institutional or enforcement language.
- Clarified the doctrine as answering **why legitimacy requires traceable cognition**,
  not how compliance is achieved.

### Structural Changes
- Full document refactor for coherence, flow, and scope control.
- Explicit separation between:
  - Doctrine (epistemic rationale)
  - Specification (NTS)
  - Governance (ARI)
  - Method (AWO)
  - Enforcement (CRI-CORE)
- Added formal sections on:
  - Cognitive provenance as a scientific primitive
  - Human vs. synthetic epistemic equality
  - Adoption as an epistemic commitment (not a checklist)

### Terminology & Precision
- Introduced a formal glossary to lock definitions and prevent semantic drift.
- Standardized use of terms such as:
  - cognition
  - traceability
  - cognitive provenance
  - epistemic legitimacy
- Replaced ambiguous language with boundary-defining statements.

### Metadata & Governance Alignment
- Updated metadata to ARI v2.0.0 standards.
- Aligned versioning, dates, and scope with ARI governance model.
- Prepared the repository for clean DOI minting on release.
- Zenodo DOI minted and linked (concept + version)

## [1.0.0] — 2025-12-01

### Initial Release
- Established Neurotransparency as a response to opacity in AI-assisted cognition.
- Introduced eight core axioms governing epistemic legitimacy.
- Positioned the doctrine as a foundational concept beneath:
  - Neurotransparency Specification (NTS)
  - Aurora Workflow Orchestration (AWO)
- Contained stronger normative language later refined in v2.0.0.

### Scope Characteristics
- Doctrine and enforcement boundaries were less explicitly separated.
- Some institutional implications were implicit rather than formally delegated.
- Served as the conceptual seed for later ARI-aligned refactoring.
